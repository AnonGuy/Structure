# Analysis

### Problem Definition and Stakeholders

The stakeholders of my application will be **fellow students of Loreto Sixth Form College**.
Being students, they need to organize revision sessions, in order to maintain the grades required
for their chosen university. Many Loreto college students have issues with organising a revision
timetable. For example, creating study sessions that do not clash with classes, or setting up
reminders for each of these study sessions, can be difficult. The needs of a College student also include
regularly checking up on their performance (grades, attendance) to ensure that they are making the
best of their study periods.

The current system for acheiving these tasks is the following:
* Checking the current timetable
* Checking grades and subject performance
* Use this information to create a manual revision timetable
* Regularly update this timetable manually based on performance

The issue with this system is that it is entirely manual, which means that students may neglect to create
or update a revision timetable. Also, the current system does not allow srudents to add their own custom
lessons, or be notified for a lesson. My idea is to have a user-friendly system that integrates all these 
features, in one easy to use web application.

My application will solve this problem, by **integrating revision session management**, **homework
reminders** and **performance analysis** in one simple dashboard. Students will be able to access this
dashboard via a **Django web application**, and possibly a **Flutter mobile application**.

In order to solve this problem with the suggested solution, I will need to learn the following:
* Usage of the Django web framework
* Usage of the PostgreSQL Database Management System with Python
* Usage of JavaScript graphing libraries such as D3.js

### Justification for Computational Method

This problem lends itself to utilization of computational methods for several reasons: <br/>

* Student performance data will be abstracted, instead displayed as as a simple line graph.
    * In order to display data as a graph, a computational device is needed.
* The application will also automatically generate a study timetable that adapts to this data.
    * This solution utilizes algorithms that can only be executed on a computational device.
* The application stack is a system that includes my webserver, which will run on a computer.

Therefore, there is no alternative solution that would not require a computer to execute.

### Applications of Computational Methods

There are several ways that computational methods can be applied to this project.

| **Method of computational thinking**  | **Explanation of relevant features** |
|:-------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| Abstract | My web application will be as user-friendly as possible. this will require me to hide certain details from the user - for example, the raw data that is scraped by my webscraper. Instead, the user will only see data that is relevant to their current page: If they are on the summary page, they will only see simple summarized data and graphs for their performance. |
| Heuristic | The summary page of my dashboard will include rounded, approximate values to represent the correlation between various properties of the student's study time, free time, grades, and punctuality. |
| Procedural | My application stack will be comprised of several Python modules, each separated into classes, methods and functions. I will be able to remove modules, test modules and edit modules in a way that does not affect any irrelevant components of the application. |
| Concurrent | The web application must be able to handle multiple HTTP requests simultaneously. I will be applying concurrent thinking to plan and design the processing and response for each request. |

### Research

I found a service that is a similar solution to my own, **showmyhomework.co.uk**, by Satchel:

#### Show my Homework

Show My Homework is a service designed for schools, that aims to unify student timetables, homework tasks and revision session management.

### Decomposing the Problem

![image](https://github.com/AnonGuy/Structure/blob/devel/write_up/images/StructureDecomposition.png?raw=true)
Using procedural thinking, I have broken down my solution into five main problems: 
* **Web Scraper**
   * The Web Scraper will be the system that communicates with MyLoreto. It will utilize the `requests` library to
   authenticate a MyLoreto session, and scrape the relevant HTML elements such as timetabled lessons, markbook grades
   and attendance data.
* **Django Webserver**
   * ​
* **Object-relational Mapper**
   * ​
* **Web Dashboard**
   * ​
* **Mobile Application.**
